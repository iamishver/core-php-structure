                    </div>
                    <div class="product-desc-detail">
                        <p>Just as every DCIM provider is not the same, not all DCIM products are the same either. </p>
                        <p>In the year 2000, NORLINX launched Global Site Management (GSM), one of the first DCIM software products in the data center industry.  Since then, NORLINX has been committed to providing our users with DCIM solutions that streamline the day-to-day management of their data center operation. </p>
                        <p>One of the cornerstones of GSM is functional simplicity, as every command in our software can be issued and executed via left or right click, or drag and drop. Unique to other DCIM providers, GSM utilizes Microsoft Visio as our GUI for floor plan management, asset management and capacity planning. This familiar and powerful tool helps minimize DCIM learning curves, helps with user adoption and gives users the information they need in reliable fashion.</p>
                        <p>Often, we hear DCIM users comparing GSM to alternative solutions, stating, "GSM is real. It provides real, meaningful data." No vaporware here. While we do not claim to be the best at every component of DCIM, we are confident in our ability to provide superior user-benefits in multiple categories. </p>
                        <p>High speed integrations are paramount to the success of any DCIM project. Some data centers have become jaded toward DCIM software, primarily based on the difficulty and time-consuming task of device integrations. NORLINX has solved that problem. GSM has been designed to be both hardware and protocol agnostic, enabling data collection to initiate at faster speeds than alternative DCIM options.  With GSM, avoid integration headaches and get your DCIM solution working for you in rapid fashion.</p>
                        <p>With high speed integrations being a pivotal component of our value proposition, GSM software suites are competitively priced, providing further cost-savings to our users. With <span class="text-green">GSMpowerlite</span>, users are provided with a free, entry-level introduction to our entire DCIM solution, ideal for smaller data centers or pilot programs in larger facilities. <span class="text-blue">GSMessential</span>, <span class="text-darkblue">GSMprofessional</span> and <span class="text-red">GSMenterprise</span>, provide features that compound on one another, all priced on a per rack basis, with no restrictions on device or user quantities. Furthermore, our software is customizable, both at the feature and modular level. In total, GSM offers a low cost of ownership that any sized data center would desire. </p>
                        <p>In addition to high speed integrations and low cost of ownership, GSM has been built on a powerful "data-driven" backend, which is the engine that fuels our ability to reliably collect and display valuable data. DCIM software needs to consistently provide users with the information they need to make decisions with clarity and peace of mind. You can trust GSM to do just that.</p>

Green initiatives and skyrocketing energy costs are compelling data center managers to make smarter, more energy-efficient choices when procuring power gear and end-user equipment.  Our power and environmental management tools are designed to expose both the elements in the data center that present a power or thermal threat to the environment and those elements that weaken the efficiency of energy and cooling resources.</p>               <!--<span><h4>Demo :</h4> <a class="sep-icon">|</a><a href="/services/schedule-a-live-demo/" class="inperson tooltip"><img alt="Inperson" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/meeting.svg"><span>Inperson</span></a>
